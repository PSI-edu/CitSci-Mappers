## Overview
We're trying to replicate the layout used in Lunar Melt in a view composition app, but we're going to be replacing the buttons with new buttons and creating tasks that draw lines in different colors.

Ask me for the information that you need as we work on the task one at a time. So what is the next button we're doing or what is the colors? You can also ask if there's anything else we have to do.

This is based on the page `lunar-melt-page.vue` but we want to edit `lunar-melt-flow-page.vue`
